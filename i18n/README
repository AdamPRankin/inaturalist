iNaturalist i18n Guidelines
1. As much as possible, employ reusable strings and keep them in the default translation files.
2. For strings specific to individual views, place them in the i18n/views directory using the same structure as app/views.
3. For views that are primarily static AND don't involve a lot of markup, make a locale-specific view, e.g. index.es.html.erb.
