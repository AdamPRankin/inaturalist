        inaturalist_provides_a_place_to: |
          %{site_name} provides a place to record and organize nature findings,
          meet other nature enthusiasts, and learn about the natural world. It
          encourages the participation of a wide variety of nature
          enthusiasts, including, but not exclusive to, hikers, hunters,
          birders, beach combers, mushroom foragers, park rangers, ecologists,
          and fishermen. Through connecting these different perceptions and
          expertise of the natural world, %{site_name} hopes to create
          extensive community awareness of local biodiversity and promote
          further exploration of local environments.

        you_can_help_inaturalist_by_giving_us_your_feedback_html: |
          You can help %{site_name} by giving us your feedback: join our 
          <a href="%{feedback_url}">feedback group</a> 
          to report bugs and request new
          features. You can also help %{site_name} by adding your observations
          and helping other community members identify their unidentified
          observations. If you know how to code and want to help work on some
          features,

        how_do_i_contact_inaturalist?: How do I contact %{site_name}
        you_can_contact_us_at_html: 'You can contact us at <a href="mailto:%{help_email}">%{help_email}</a>'
        what_are_admins_and_curators?: What are admins and curators?
        inat_admins_are_the_people_who: |
          %{site_name} admins are the people who run the site. They have direct access
          to the underlying code and the database, and they can change anything
          on the site.
        curators_are_inat_users_who_volunteer_to_html: |
          Curators are %{site_name} users who volunteer to help keep our taxonomic data
          up to date. If you're interested in becoming a curator, please 
          <a href="mailto:%{help_email}">contact us</a>. Curators can
          also promote other users to curator status. Please only promote people
          you trust and that you know to have some taxonomic knowledge.
        what_is_considered_inappropriate_content?: What is considered inappropriate content?
        you_know_it_when_you_see_it_html: | 
          You <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio">know it when you see it</a>, 
          right?  Stuff that violates Section 2 of our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> 
          is definitely inappropriate and worth flagging or otherwise notifying
          the admins about. Milder forms of rudeness are unfortunate, but
          probably not something we'll delete. Observations of pets, captive
          animals, humans, and other organisms most naturalists may not find
          interesting are ok (they're alive, after all). Observations of things
          that aren't organisms are a gray area. Things that clearly have
          nothing to do with nature, like what someone had for lunch, are worth
          flagging and may be deleted, but evidence of pollution or disturbance
          could be interesting, and probably won't be removed.
        what_is_an_observation?: What is an observation?
        an_observation_is_the_what_where_and_when_html: |
          An observation is the what, where, and when of a finding in nature. 
          %{site_name} provides a place to add this information along with associated text, 
          photos, and tags. %{site_name} encourages the recording of all nature findings, 
          whether they feature identified species or simple narrative descriptions. 
          (In %{site_name} the same lizard can be described as a Desert Horned Lizard as well 
          as &quot;Mystery Lizard of Death Valley&quot;)
        why_doesnt_inaturalist_recognize_the_name_ive_entered?: "Why doesn't %{site_name} recognize the name I've entered?"
        inaturalist_has_name_information_for_mammals:  |
          %{site_name} has name information for mammals, birds, reptiles,
          and amphibians, and continues to add new species names into our
          database. If we do not recognize a particular name, try
          alternative names that we might recognize and add the original
          name to the tags or description fields.
        how_can_i_get_help_identifying_what_i_saw?: How can I get help identifying what I saw?
        check_the_id_please_checkbox_when_html: | 
          Check the "ID Please" checkbox when adding / editing your
          observation and your observation will appear in
          <a href="%{url}">ID Please</a>.
        what_does_it_mean_to_link_inaturalist_to_my_flickr_account?: What does it mean to link %{site_name} to my Flickr account?
        inaturalist_can_link_directly_to_the_flickr_photo_service: | 
          %{site_name} can link directly to the Flickr photo service so
          that you can add your Flickr photos to your observations. When
          you agree to link your Flickr account, you are simply linking
          two accounts; we do not have access to your Flickr password and
          you are not forsaking your copyright nor giving us the ability
          to use any of your photos in ways that you do not want.
        can_i_add_photos_without_a_flickr_account?: Can I add photos without a Flickr account?
        we_also_support_picasa_html:  'We also support Picasa: <a href="%{url}">Configure your Picasa account &raquo;</a>'
        we_also_support_uploading_photos: |
                We also support uploading photos directly to %{site_name}, but it can be a bit
                slow, so we only allow one upload at a time. Using Flickr or Picasa is
                probably faster if you already use those services.
        what_are_tags?:  What are tags?
        tags_are_keywords_you_can_add_to_an_html: |
          Tags are keywords you can add to an observation to make them easier to find. 
          For example, if a barracuda followed you on a scuba diving trip in Turks and Caicos, 
          you might tag the observation &quot;scary, barracuda, scuba diving, vacation, turks and caicos&quot;.
        can_i_include_my_observations_on_my_blog?: Can I include my %{site_name} observations on my own website of blog?
        sure_check_out_our_widget_html: |
          Sure, check out our <a href="%{url}" title="Observations Widget">Observations Widget</a>.
        what_kind_of_photos_should_i_attach: What kind of photos should I attach to observations?  Can I attach photos I didn't take?
        photos_attached_to_observations_should_be: | 
          Photos attached to observations should be of the individual observed
          at the time of the observation. If you record an observation of a
          tree, then go back a day later to take a picture, please add a new
          observation for the picture, because it represents the tree at a
          different point in time.
        please_do_not_upload_pictures_you_didnt_take_html: | 
          Please <em>do not upload pictures you didn't take</em> unless you have
          obtained permission from the photographer. It is illegal to publish
          copyrighted works without some form of license granted by the creator
          of the work, and all photographers have full copyright over their
          photos by default. If the photo was of the thing you observed, and
          someone else took it and you've obtained their permission to publish
          it, you should also note the name of the photographer in the
          observation's description.
        what_is_geoprivacy?: What is geoprivacy?
        geoprivacy_is_a_setting_you_can: |
          Geoprivacy is a setting you can make on your observations that
          controls how the spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) are 
          displayed. Here are the options:
        note_that_curators_of: | 
          Note that curators of individual projects can always see the
          coordinates regardless of your geoprivacy setting, so if you are
          concerned about who has access to the coordinates you should be sure
          you trust the curators of the projects in which you participate.
        what_is_does_it_mean_for: What is does it mean for an observation to be obscured?
        when_coordinates_are_obscured_it_means_that: |
          When coordinates are obscured it means that a random point within
          %{km}KM of the true coordinates 
          is shown publicly (i.e. on the home page, the observations page, and 
          project pages), while the true coordinates are only visible when you
          are viewing your own observations (i.e. on the individual project
          pages and the list of your own observations). Note that curators of
          the projects to which you've added an observation can also see the
          true coordinates. Obscured coordinates should always be symbolized by
          circular marker without stems on maps and in geospatial feeds.
        coordinates_are_obscured_for_all_taxa: | 
          Coordinates are automatically obscured for all taxa that are "NEAR
          THREATENED" or worse according to the IUCN Red List. Some taxa may be
          declared threatened according to other conservation authorities, and
          some may be simply marked as threatened by %{site_name} site curators if they
          believe it merits protection.
        you_can_also_obscure_the_coordinates_html: | 
          You can also obscure the coordinates of your own observations 
          regardless of what the taxon is.  See <a href="#geoprivacy">geoprivacy</a> above.
        what_is_the_quality_assessment: What is the quality assessment and how do observations qualify to become "research" grade?
        what_is_a_life_list?: What is a life list?
        just_a_simple_list: Just a simple list of taxa with no special behavior.
        automatically_updates_based_on_your_observations: |
          Automatically updates based on your observations. Everyone on %{site_name}
          has a default life list that contains every species that person has
          observed. If you delete an observation or change your ID, the
          species will get removed. You can also manually add taxa to your
          life list just like you can with an ordinary list. The species you
          add manually won't get removed if you observe them and then delete
          the observation.
        you_can_also_make_additional_life_lists: |
          You can also make additional life lists for specific groups of
          organisms, like a life list of birds, or a life list of milkweeds.
        a_project_list_belongs: |
          A project list belongs to a project and lists all the taxa
          observed by members of that project. Project lists can also be
          populated manually by the admin of that project, and can be used
          to restrict project contributions to taxa that are on the list.
        a_check_list_is_html: |
          A check list is a list of taxa that occur in a place. Every place
          has a default check list, and whenever an observation is made
          within the place's boundaries <em>and</em> it has achieved
          research-grade status, the species observed will get automatically
          added to the place's check list.
        inat_users_can_also: |
          %{site_name} users can also add additional check lists to places, but
          these check lists are not automatically updated. They mainly
          provide a way for people to bring in outside sources of data or
          just list things based on their own experience.
        is_a_list_of_every_species_that_you_have_seen: |
          A life list is a list of every species that you have seen. Every %{site_name} user has a life 
          list and these lists are automatically populated from the observations added to %{site_name}.
        i_observed_a_species: "I observed a species, why isn't it showing up in my life list?"
        while_the_life_list_is_automatically_populated: |
                While the life list is automatically populated from added
                observations, the species will not be added to this list if
                %{site_name} does not recognize the name you used. We recommend
                trying alternative names that we might recognize.
