    <p>
      The iNaturalist Network is a collection of localized websites in the global iNaturalist community. Network sites are supported by local institutions that promote local participation and facilitate the use of data from iNaturalist to benefit local biodiversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice per year, iNaturalist shares some hidden coordinates (i.e. coordinates publicly obscured or private) with the iNaturalist Network Members to facilitate the use of iNaturalist data for research, conservation, and management in their respective countries. The two ways that coordinates can be hidden are shared differently, as described below.

      If you live in or frequently visit a country that is a member of the Network, you are encouraged to choose that as your affiliation to facilitate data sharing.

      iNaturalist Canada enables data from iNaturalist to be incorporated into secure, provincial-level systems managed by Conservation Data Centers (CDCs). These systems are used when assessments are carried out (twice per year) to determine the at-risk status of species, as well in determining the critical habitat of threatened and endangered species. CDCs may provide a subset of their data to organizations or individuals who have demonstrated a need for such data, and have signed a data license and/or confidentiality agreement, and/or undertaken accredited data sensitivity training. As a result of sharing these data, it has been possible to locate and mitigate hotspots of road mortality for species at risk; delineate and eventually protect Key Biodiversity Areas, and; reconfirm the presence of species that had not been reported for decades.
