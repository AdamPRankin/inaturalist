# TODO:
#  * removing all taxonomic rules should result in a list with all the taxa 
#    the user has seen
#  * adding a taxonomic rule should make a list with only taxa that match 
#    that rule
#  * deleting the only observation a user has made of a taxon should remove
#    that taxon from the list
#  * deleting an observation of a taoxn the user has seen more than once 
#    should leave the taxon in the list AND set the listed_taxon's 
#    last_observation to the next most recent observation of the taxon
