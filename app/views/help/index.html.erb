      <h5><a name="general1">What is iNaturalist?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist provides a place to record and organize nature findings,
        meet other nature enthusiasts, and learn about the natural world. It
        encourages the participation of a wide variety of nature
        enthusiasts, including, but not exclusive to, hikers, hunters,
        birders, beach combers, mushroom foragers, park rangers, ecologists,
        and fishermen. Through connecting these different perceptions and
        expertise of the natural world, iNaturalist hopes to create
        extensive community awareness of local biodiversity and promote
        further exploration of local environments.

      <h5><a name="general2">Who is behind iNaturalist?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist was originally the Master'ss Final Project of Nathan Agrin,
        Jessica Kline, and Ken-ichi Ueda at UC Berkeley's 
        <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu">School of Information</a>.
        Currently Ken-ichi maintains the project, with occasional help
        and guidance from Nate.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="general3">What technologies and data sources does the project use?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist is built using <a
        href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a
        href="http://mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a
        href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a
        href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps//">Google Maps</a>, and <a
        href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. It also utilizes the <a
        href="http://www.catalogueoflife.org">Catalogue of Life</a> and
        <a href="http://ubio.org/">uBio</a> data sources for taxonomic data.

  <h4>
    Observations
  </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations1">What is an observation?</a></h5>
      <p>An observation is the what, where, and when of a finding in nature. iNaturalist provides a place to add this information along with associated text, photos, and tags. iNaturalist encourages the recording of all nature findings, whether they feature identified species or simple narrative descriptions. (In iNaturalist the same lizard can be described as a Desert Horned Lizard as well as &quot;Mystery Lizard of Death Valley&quot;.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations2">Why doesn't iNaturalist recognize the name I've entered?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist has name information for mammals, birds, reptiles,
        and amphibians, and continues to add new species names into our
        database. If we do not recognize a particular name, try
        alternative names that we might recognize and add the original
        name to the tags or description fields.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations3">How can I get help identifying what I saw?</a></h5>
      <p>
        Check the "ID Please" checkbox when adding / editing your
        observation and your observation will appear in
        <a href="http://inaturalist.org/observations/id_please" title="iNaturalist.org &middot; ID Please!">ID Please</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations4">What does it mean to link iNaturalist to my Flickr account?</a></h5>
      <p>
        iNaturalist can link directly to the Flickr photo service so
        that you can add your Flickr photos to your observations. When
        you agree to link your Flickr account, you are simply linking
        two accounts; we do not have access to your Flickr password and
        you are not forsaking your copyright nor giving us the ability
        to use any of your photos in ways that you do not want.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations5">Can I add photos without a Flickr account?</a></h5>
      <p>
        We also support Picasa: <a href="http://inaturalist.org/picasa/options">Configure your Picasa account &raquo;</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can still add photos to your observation without a
        photo provider account: First identify the url of your photo and then
        paste the following image html into the description field:
        &lt;img src=&quot;url&quot;&gt;.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations6">What are tags?</a></h5>
      <p>Tags are keywords you can add to an observation to make them easier to find. For example, if a barracuda followed you on a scuba diving trip in Turks and Caicos, you might tag the observation &quot;scary, barracuda, scuba diving, vacation, turks and caicos&quot;.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="observations7">Can I include my iNat observations on my own website of blog?</a></h5>
      <p>
        Sure, check out our <a href="http://inaturalist.org/observations/widget" title="Observations Widget">Observations Widget</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  
  <h4>
    Lists
  </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="lists1">What is a life list?</a></h5>
      <p>A life list is a list of every species that you have seen. Every iNaturalist user has a life list and these lists are automatically populated from the observations added to iNaturalist.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5><a name="lists2">I observed a species, why isn't it showing up in my life list?</a></h5>
      <p>
        While the life list is automatically populated from added
        observations, the species will not be added to this list if
        iNaturalist does not recognize the name you used. We recommend
        trying alternative names that we might recognize.
      </p>
