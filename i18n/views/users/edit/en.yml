        taxon_change_desc: |
          When taxa are merged or renamed on iNat, your observations, listed
          taxa, identifications, etc. will be automatically updated to the new
          taxa if the change is unambiguous. If you opt out or the change is
          ambiguous (e.g. a split), you will receive an update about the
          change linking to a tool you can use to manually update your content
          if you choose.
